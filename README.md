# Computer Architecture Project 1 – MIPS Assembly

## 📌 Course
ENCS4370 – Computer Architecture

## 📖 Description
This project focuses on programming using the MIPS assembly language to reinforce core computer architecture concepts.
The goal is to understand how high-level logic is executed at the instruction level using registers, memory, and the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA).

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Implement a complete program using MIPS assembly
- Work directly with registers and memory
- Process input data using low-level instructions
- Understand instruction execution and data flow in MIPS architecture

## ⚙️ Key Concepts
- MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Register usage and conventions
- Memory access (load/store)
- Control flow instructions
- Low-level program execution

## 📂 Files
- `mips2.asm` – MIPS assembly program
- `input.txt` – Input data file
- `code.txt` – Additional code or output reference
- `ENCS4370_Project_1_Spring_2024_2025.pdf` – Project description

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project strengthens understanding of how software interacts with hardware at the architectural level and demonstrates practical knowledge of assembly programming and MIPS processor behavior.
