# Computer Architecture Projects (ENCS4370)

This repository contains two major projects developed as part of the **ENCS4370 – Computer Architecture** course.
The projects focus on understanding processor architecture concepts through **MIPS assembly programming** and **datapath / control design**.

---

## 🧩 Project 1 – MIPS Assembly Programming

### Description
This project focuses on implementing a complete program using **MIPS assembly language**.
The objective is to understand how high-level program logic is executed at the architectural level using registers, memory, and instructions.

### Key Objectives
- Write and execute a MIPS assembly program
- Use registers and memory explicitly
- Process input data using low-level instructions
- Apply control flow and arithmetic operations in MIPS

### Core Concepts
- MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Register usage and conventions
- Load/store memory operations
- Branching and control flow
- Instruction-level execution

### Files
- `mips2.asm` – MIPS assembly source code
- `input.txt` – Input data file
- `code.txt` – Additional code or output reference
- `ENCS4370_Project_1_Spring_2024_2025.pdf` – Project description

### Learning Outcome
This project strengthens understanding of how software interacts with hardware at the instruction level and provides hands-on experience with assembly programming and MIPS processor behavior.

## 🧩 Project 2 – Datapath and Control Design (Multi-Cycle MIPS)

### Description
This project focuses on analyzing and designing the **datapath and control unit** of a MIPS processor.
The goal is to understand how instructions are executed across multiple cycles and how control signals coordinate datapath components.

### Key Objectives
- Analyze instruction execution across multiple cycles
- Design and understand datapath components
- Study the role of control signals in processor operation
- Relate instruction behavior to hardware execution stages

### Core Concepts
- Multi-cycle processor design
- Datapath components (ALU, registers, memory)
- Control unit functionality
- Instruction execution stages
- Architectural performance considerations

### Files
- `Project-2-Spring-2024-2025.pdf` – Project description and specifications

### Learning Outcome
This project provides a deeper understanding of processor internals, including datapath organization and control logic, and demonstrates how instructions are implemented at the hardware level.
